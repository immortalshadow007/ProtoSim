# ProtoSim
ProtoSim: A comprehensive framework for simulating real-time data to conduct A/B testing on AI model prototypes. This project automates the generation of random data to test baseline versions against variants, providing a robust analysis script for evaluating model performance and decision-making. Ideal for researchers and developers seeking to optimize AI models before deployment.

Note: This project is a work in progress
