### ProtoSim: Automated A/B Testing Framework

**Description:**

ProtoSim is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate automated A/B testing for AI model prototypes. The project workflow involves:

1. **Data Generation**: Creates random data for two app variations.
2. **Data Analysis**: Processes the generated data through an analysis pipeline, producing insights and visualizations.
3. **Data Storage**: Organizes analyzed data in a PostgreSQL database, while storing graph images in a local folder and recording their file paths in the database.

**Key Features:**
- **Automated A/B Testing**: Seamlessly generates and analyzes data for different app variations.
- **Data Insights**: Provides detailed analysis and visual representation of results.
- **Efficient Storage**: Manages data and visualizations efficiently using PostgreSQL and local file storage.

This project demonstrates advanced skills in data generation, analysis, visualization, and database management, leveraging Python and PostgreSQL for robust performance and organization.
